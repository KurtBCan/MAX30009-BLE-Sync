This repostory includes code for interfacing nRF52840 based Seeed Studio Xiao boards with MAX30009 bioimpedance sensors. 
A DS3231 based Adafruit RTC board is used as a 32.768 kHz frequency reference for the MAX30009.

Two MAX30009s are initialized simultaneously using an adverrtisment signal from a controller nRF52 to peripheral nRF52 boards connected to the MAX30009s. 
For more information, see "Analysis of Timing Behavior for Wireless Synchronization of Bioimpedance Analog Front End Sensors".
